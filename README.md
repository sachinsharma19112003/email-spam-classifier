## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a Machine Learning–based web application that classifies SMS messages as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

The trained model and TF-IDF vectorizer are loaded using Pickle, and the application is deployed using Streamlit for real-time prediction.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Spam messages are a common issue in digital communication. Detecting spam automatically helps improve user experience and security.

The goal of this project is to build a text classification model that can accurately identify spam messages.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow

### 1️⃣ Text Preprocessing

* Cleaning text
* Removing stopwords
* Tokenization

### 2️⃣ Feature Extraction

* TF-IDF Vectorization used to convert text into numerical format.

### 3️⃣ Model Training

* Supervised classification model trained on labeled SMS dataset.

### 4️⃣ Model Saving

Trained model saved as:

```
spam_model.pkl
```

Vectorizer saved as:

```
